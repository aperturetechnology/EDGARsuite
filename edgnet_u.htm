	<h1 style="text-align: center">Using EDGARsuite<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align:top">™</span> on a network</h1>
	<h2>Your User ID</h2>
	<p>Before you use EDGARsuite™ on a network, your network administrator must assign you a 
	User ID. This may be any combination of up to 8 letters and/or numbers. When 
	you start an EDGARsuite™ module, the software asks you to enter this User ID. After that, 
	it works just like the single-user version, as described in the 
	user manual.<br>
	<br>
	To avoid having to enter your User ID each time you start an EDGARsuite™ 
	program, you 
	may enter it into the Windows shortcuts used to start these programs. To do 
	this, append a space and then <span class="aci-code">USR(<i>xxxxxx</i>)</span> to the command line in the 
	shortcut (where <i>xxxxxx</i> stands for your User ID). Thereafter, these 
	programs 
	will not ask you for your User ID when started using these shortcuts.</p>
	<h2>Start-up Error Messages</h2>
	<p>If a message is displayed that your User ID is invalid, 
	please check the spelling of the ID and enter it again. If the problem 
	persists, consult your network administrator to make sure that your ID has 
	been set up correctly.<br>
	<br>
	There is a limit on the number of users who may simultaneously use the copy 
	of EDGARsuite™ installed on your network. This limit was specified when the 
	product was ordered. If the maximum number of users are already using the 
	copy of EDGARsuite™ you are trying to use, a message is displayed on your screen asking you to try again later. In that case, you must 
	wait until one of the other users finishes using the software.</p>
