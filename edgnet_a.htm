Reference</h1>
<h2>Setting up EDGARsuite<span style="font-size:6pt; vertical-align:top">™</span> for network operation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 4pt">Run the EDGARsuite™ installer
	on the file server from the server console (do not do this remotely).</p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 4pt">Create a folder named
	<span class="aci-code">ES.SYS</span> within the folder where EDGARsuite™ is
installed (typically, <span class="aci-code">C:\Aci Programs\EDGsuite</span>).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Assign each EDGARsuite™ user a unique User ID (up to 8 letters and/or
numbers). For each user, create a folder within the EDGARsuite folder, named
	<span class="aci-code">x.USR</span> (where x is the User ID). To remove a user
permanently, remove the corresponding <span class="aci-code">x.USR</span>
folder. A user may be added at any time, but removed only when he/she is not
using the software.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting up Client computers</h2>
<p>To set up EDGARsuite™ on a client computer, run the file <span class="aci-code">
EdgIns.exe</span> located in the folder where EDGARsuite™
is installed. This file must be run on each client computer from its original location on the server. Do
not copy the file to the client computer. Beyond this, the installation process
is automatic. It creates a folder named <span class="aci-code">EDGARsuite</span>
on the client's desktop and in the <span class="aci-code">Start Menu</span> with
links to software and resources on the server.</p>
<h2>User Management</h2>
<p>To identify users who are using EDGARsuite™, look at the contents of the
<span class="aci-code"> ES.SYS</span> folder. Each active User ID using the
program is shown there by a file bearing the name of the user ID, with
<span class="aci-code">.ON</span> extension. The date and time of this file
indicates when that copy of EDGARsuite™ was started.<br>
<br>
EDGARsuite™ adds a <span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.ON</span> file to the
<span class="aci-code">ES.SYS</span> folder when a user starts the
program, and deletes it on exit. However, if the program terminates abnormally,
the <span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.ON</span> file may remain there, and
must be deleted manually. When doing so, first ensure that the user is not using
the program. Never delete a <span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.ON</span> file
while a user is using the program.</p>
<h2>Security and Advanced Options</h2>
<p>For added network security, you may write-protect the folder where EDGARsuite™
is installed (typically, <span class="aci-code">C:\Aci Programs\EDGsuite</span>).
The <span class="aci-code">ES.SYS</span> folder must, however, support read+write access. If you
wish, you may assign individual users access only to their own specific
<span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.USR</span> folders to keep them from using
other users' accounts.<br>
<br>
For advanced networking options, you may create a text file called
<span class="aci-code">ES.NET</span> in the folder where EDGARsuite™ is
installed, into which you may place one
or more of the following commands:</p>
<p><span class="aci-code">SYS=<i>SysDirectory</i><br>
USR=<i>UsrDirectory</i><br>
CUST=<i>Yes/No</i><br>
DRIVES=<i>Yes/No</i></span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p style="text-indent: -10pt; margin-left: 10pt"><i>SysDirectory</i> represents
the complete path name of the folder which should replace the
<span class="aci-code">ES.SYS</span> folder. If this entry
is not specified, <span class="aci-code">ES.SYS</span> as
described above is used.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -10pt; margin-left: 10pt"><i>UsrDirectory</i> represents
the complete path name template of the directories to replace the
<span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.USR</span> folders. In this
template, an asterisk (*) may be used as a place holder for the User ID. If this
entry is not specified, the <span class="aci-code"><i>UserID</i>.USR</span>
folders as described above are used.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -10pt; margin-left: 10pt"><i>CUST=</i> specifies whether
or not users should be allowed access to EDGARwiz's Advanced Customization
options. If this entry is not specified, <i>Yes</i> is assumed. This entry does
not apply to the other EDGARsuite™ components.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -10pt; margin-left: 10pt"><i>DRIVES=</i> specifies
whether or not network drives should show up in users' file navigation dialog
boxes. If this entry is not specified, <i>Yes</i> is assumed.</p>
<p>The above entries may be entered in upper, lower or mixed case. There should
be no spaces within an entry, not even before or after the '=' symbol.</p>
